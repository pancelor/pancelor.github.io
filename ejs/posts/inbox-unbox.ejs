  <p>This is my upcoming puzzle game about pushing boxes into other boxes. It's 10~30 hours long? (It's hard to estimate puzzle game times...)

  <p>Inspired by: <a href="https://juner.itch.io/sokosoko">sokosoko</a></p>

  <p>Also, if this game looks up your alley, go wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260520/Patricks_Parabox/">Patrick's Parabox</a>, an upcoming game with a similar premise! I've played the demo and it looks like it's going to be good!</p>

  <p>Here's a slower-paced video, showing off a single puzzle. Can you solve it just from watching it?</p>

  <h3>engine</h3>
  <p>For this game, I wrote a custom javascript engine. It runs in the browser, using the html <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> tag to display the game. I've learned a whole lot about game-making since starting this project, and I often get the urge to completely rewrite this in, say, C... but for now it's written in javascript :)</p>

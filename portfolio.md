## [necrodecorator](https://pancelor.itch.io/necrodecorator)

A game about decorating an inn to make the denizens from [Crypt of the NecroDancer](https://braceyourselfgames.com/crypt-of-the-necrodancer/) feel cozy when they visit. Made for a 7-day game jam with [cryss](twitter.com/princryss); I did all the code and cryss did all of the art/sound.

This was a really fun project that taught me a lot about scoping a game, and how difficult even the most basic 3d stuff can be. (the game is hardly 3D but I spent most of my time making the objects render in the correct order)

## [upgo](https://pancelor.itch.io/upgo)

Made over 2 weeks for [lowrezjam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2020)). An exercise in making a platformer with "good game feel" (coyote frames, automatic x-adjustment when hitting the edge of an overhang, queued jump inputs, etc)

This was my first time doing procgen I think? That was a fun learning experience. I leaned on [this explanation](http://tinysubversions.com/spelunkyGen/) of Spelunky's level generation. Also, I feel like a switch has flipped in my brain about coordinate systems - there is no "correct" way to do coordinates you just interpret some numbers however you want.

I wish I had spent more time making this into a real game - there's some good platformer feel and some decent level generation, but not much game to speak of. I would have like to add powerups or items or something.

## [hexringer](https://pancelor.itch.io/hexringer)

A recreation (with a twist!) of a boss from Crypt of the NecroDancer. Made for a 1-day long game jam. I just like this boss and wanted to see how hard it would be to make. Also, I mainly just wanted to see how hard/fun it would be to fight Dead Ringer on a hexagonal grid.

I'm surprised that this went as smoothly as it did. I scraped together some html game code from another game I'm making, so writing that boilerplate wasn't a hurdle, but I'm surprised the first thing I tried for enemy AI actually worked.

Hi! You're here early. I'll set up a proper page here later.

The short version: Pineapple Express is a free [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) plugin I'm making that helps you make [Flatgames](https://flatgame.itch.io/first-timers-tutorial). It's heavily inspired by [Downpour](https://downpour.games/).

The plugin is not published yet. Check back here later or [follow me](/contact) for updates.

A recreation (with a twist!) of a boss from Crypt of the NecroDancer. Made for a 1-day long game jam.

### explanation

I just like this boss and wanted to see how hard it would be to recreate. Also, I wanted to see how hard/fun it would be to fight Dead Ringer on a hexagonal grid.

I'm surprised that this went as smoothly as it did. I scraped together some html game code from another game I'm making, so writing the game engine wasn't much of a hurdle, but I'm surprised the first thing I tried for enemy AI actually worked.

This was made in a custom javascript engine.

### explanation

A game about decorating an inn to make the denizens from <a href="https://braceyourselfgames.com/crypt-of-the-necrodancer/">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a> feel cozy when they visit. Made for a 7-day game jam with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/princryss">@princryss</a>; I did all the code and cryss did all of the art and sound.

This was a really fun project that taught me a lot about scoping a game, and how difficult even the most basic 3D stuff can be. (the game is hardly 3D but I spent most of my time making the objects render in the correct order)

It's got some replayability (to try and figure out the monster preferences), but you might be confused unless you're familiar with necrodancer already :)

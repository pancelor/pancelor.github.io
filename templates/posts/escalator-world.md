This was an exercise in really really polishing up all of the non-gameplay parts of a game. I think of it as the [coinstar monologue](https://youtu.be/w20iz92QUco), but for videogames :)

Play it online [here](https://pancelor.itch.io/escalator-world)! I'm not going to say much about it in this post because that would spoil the entire point of the game :) It's pretty short. (?)

### explanation

I made this in a week using the pico-8 engine. It's based on an old game maker game back in the yoyogames era called "Escalator World" by LeGuy. It's one of my favorites; one of the few I made sure to download before the yoyogames forums were lost to time...

### music

This was my first time writing game music! I'm happy with how it turned out!

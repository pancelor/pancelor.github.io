_Inbox Unbox is still in-progress! It's on the back burner for now; I painted myself into a design corner and have been letting it simmer._

This is my upcoming puzzle game about pushing boxes into other boxes. It's 10\~30 hours long? (It's hard to estimate puzzle game times...)

Inspired by: [sokosoko](https://juner.itch.io/sokosoko)

Here's a slower-paced video, showing off a single puzzle. Can you solve it just from watching it?

If this game looks up your alley, be sure to also check out [Patrick's Parabox](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260520/Patricks_Parabox/)! It starts from a similar premise (we were both inspired by sokosoko) but explores the ideas in different ways.

[Make Ten Deluxe](https://pancelor.itch.io/make-ten-deluxe) is an expansion pack that builds on the original [Make Ten](https://pancelor.itch.io/make-ten), featuring **35+ variant modes**. Click and drag to select numbers that add to 10, removing them from the board. Each number removed gives points, but I hear there's a strange way to get more score. Maybe it's a bug?

That's classic Make 10. This deluxe edition adds 35+ variations on that theme. Some modes modify the rules slightly in ways that significantly change the flavor of the game, some modes are particularly puzzley situations for you to solve, and some modes are too strange and specific to describe.

There's something for everybody to love: each of the game's dozens of modes were carefully chosen to be interesting, surprising, or otherwise delightful.

  <h1>Variety Mega Jam (dec 2020)</h1>

  <p>The <a href="https://itch.io/jam/vmj2020">Variety MegaJam</a> is a game jam hosted by <a href="https://www.droqen.com/">droqen</a> in which you make 10 games in 10 days, each in a different genre, with an expected playtime of about 10 minutes each.</p>
  <p>This was exhausting but incredibly fun! I met my goal of finishing within the 31 days of Decemeber, and keeping the amount of work within 10 days. I might write more about this later because it was a wild, excellent experience.</p>
  <p>For now, here's a list of the games I made:</p>
  <p><ul>
    <li>day 1: <a href="https://pancelor.itch.io/typefight">typefight</a>: fun! arcade typing with a twist.</li>
    <li>day 2: <a href="https://pancelor.itch.io/remains">remains</a>: story-driven. I'm really proud of what I was able to pull off with this one.</li>
    <li>day 3: <a href="https://pancelor.itch.io/microwave2">Microwave 2</a>: a small simulation of some microwave design improvements.</li>
    <li>day 4: <a href="https://pancelor.itch.io/bakeshoppe">bakeshoppe</a>: fun? a cook-serve-delicious-like.</li>
    <li>day 5: <a href="https://pancelor.itch.io/chickenswamp">chickenswamp</a>: a silly little puzzle game! I'm quite happy with how this one turned out.</li>
    <li>day 6: <a href="https://pancelor.itch.io/minetris">minetris</a>: an arcade action mashup of minecraft and tetris. sounds like a meme, but I think it turned out really good somehow?</li>
    <li>day 7: <a href="https://pancelor.itch.io/textorio">textorio</a>: factorio, except as a text adventure! Very unfinished, I burnt out before I could implement the cool things I wanted to experiment with.</li>
    <li>day 8: <a href="https://pancelor.itch.io/droqencake">droqencake</a>: a cake for droqen! :)</li>
    <li>day 9: <a href="https://pancelor.itch.io/violin">violin</a>: a violin simulator. disclaimer: bad, and not in a meme way. do not play if you know anything about violin because I'm sure it's very wrong. This was mainly just me learning Godot.</li>
    <li>day 10: <a href="https://pancelor.itch.io/newyear">newyear</a>: a tiny shooter made in one hour! I forced myself to only spend one hour on this 1. for fun, and 2. because I'd gone over my 10 day budget on the earlier games</li>
  </ul></p>

  <p>I'm sorta floored by how well this went. A lot of these games aren't very interesting, but somehow I'm really proud of how... three of them turned out?! That's WAY higher than I was expecting. My favorites are Remains, Chickenswamp, and Minetris. Check them out! (also, Typefight is pretty good for a laugh!)</p>

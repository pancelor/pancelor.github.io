  <h3>explanation</h3>
  <p>A game about decorating an inn to make the denizens from <a href="https://braceyourselfgames.com/crypt-of-the-necrodancer/">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a> feel cozy when they visit. Made for a 7-day game jam with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/princryss">@cryss</a>; I did all the code and cryss did all of the art and sound.</p>

  <p>This was a really fun project that taught me a lot about scoping a game, and how difficult even the most basic 3D stuff can be. (the game is hardly 3D but I spent most of my time making the objects render in the correct order)</p>

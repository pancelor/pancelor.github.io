  <h1>Tetris Clone (may 2020)</h1>
  <p>(this page is under construction!)</p>
  <p>I did this project one week when I neeeded a break from my bigger projects. I decided I wanted to get a visceral feel for how hard it is to finish a game; surely it's hard? But how hard? So I decided to clone Tetris (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(Game_Boy_video_game)">gameboy version</a>) down to a tiny level of detail to see how much work it would take.</p>
  <p>Turns out, it takes a lot of work :)</p>

  <p>TODO: talk about carmack one-place email, link to purple gun game for engine tech, talk about state machine, animation, line clear animation intricacies</p>

  <h1>PuzzleScript Level Select (jul 2020)</h1>
  <p>Play <a href="https://thinkycollective.itch.io/dr-jelly-and-mr-slime">this game</a> to see it in action. (I did not make this game, I just wrote the forked level-select-enabled engine that the authors used)</p>
  <p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/pancelor/PuzzleScript/tree/level-select">source</a>, if you like. </p>

  <h3>explanation</h3>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/">PuzzleScript engine</a> is an existing tool that I did not write. I've made a few games in it, and I wanted to add a level select screen to my games. I've seen this done in various ways but never found them completely satisfying, so I edited the code for the puzzlescript engine itself and added level select capabilities.</p>
  <p>I'm very happy with the result! I think it blends into the existing engine pretty seamlessly, from a player's perspective.</p>
  <p>This was a nice exercise in jumping into someone else's code and editing it without understanding the whole thing. Also, someone submitted a pull request to make the level select screen remember which levels you've beaten previously, which was exciting! Overall this was a good experience in collaboration.</p>

  ## [Guided Sock Meditation](https://pancelor.itch.io/guided-sock-meditation)

  A puzzle game about matching socks.

  This game was an exercise in taking some very simple puzzle rules and really exploring them to see what interesting puzzles I could find. I also created a custom level select screen completely from scratch in a way that I think blends into the puzzlescript engine in a really nice way; this was nice exercise in jumping into a codebase and editing someone else's code


TODO: make a twitch highlight or something showing this off?

  ## game-boy tetris clone

  A self-study project to learn about game feel and game polish.
  I learned a lot from it and am very pleased with how it turned out.

  <h1>Software Renderer (sep 2020)</h1>
  <p>This is a 3D renderer that doesn't use the GPU at all; it does all the triangle math manually on the CPU and individually sets the color of each pixel shown onscreen. This was a fun experience learning a bit about how 3D graphics work. I only use "fast" operations while rasterizing the triangles (i.e. no floating-point division).</p>
  <p>I looked up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm">how to draw 2D lines</a> but had to figure out the rest on my own.</p>

  <h3>progress</h3>
  Check out this <a href="https://twitter.com/pancelor/status/1307774529565896705">twitter thread</a> showing my step-by-step progress, from individual triangles all the way up to a lit 3D scene!

  <h3>performance</h3>
  <p>The teapot is made of 3752 triangles / 1976 vertices, and the renderer runs at around 5ms per frame. I haven't done the research to figure out how good that really is (and I haven't attempted to optimize the renderer, beyond my "fast math" design restrictions) but I can spin this particular teapot around at 60fps with plenty of time to spare :)</p>

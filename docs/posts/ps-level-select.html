  <h1 class="post-title">PuzzleScript Level Select</h1>
  <h4 class="post-meta">2020-07</h4>
  <p>This isn't a game, it's just a small feature that I added to a custom fork of puzzlescript: a level select screen. Check out <a href="https://thinkycollective.itch.io/dr-jelly-and-mr-slime">this game</a> or <a href="/posts/guided-sock-meditation">this game</a> to see it in action!</p>

  <h3>can I use this?</h3>
  <p>Sure! To use it in your own games, use the online editor <a href="https://pancelor.github.io/PuzzleScript/editor.html">here</a>, and check out the documentation <a href="https://pancelor.github.io/PuzzleScript/Documentation/levels.html">here</a>! (search for <code>enable_level_select</code>) If you want, send me a message about what you make; I'd love to see it!</p>

  <p>If you're interested in the code, check it out <a href="https://github.com/pancelor/PuzzleScript/tree/level-select">here</a>. </p>

  <h3>explanation</h3>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/">PuzzleScript engine</a> is an existing tool that I did not write. I've made a few games in it, and I wanted to add a level select screen to my games. I've seen this done in various ways but never found them completely satisfying, so I edited the code for the puzzlescript engine itself and added level select capabilities.</p>
  <p>I'm very happy with the result! I think it blends into the existing engine pretty seamlessly, from a player's perspective.</p>
  <p>This was a nice exercise in jumping into someone else's code and editing it without understanding the whole thing. Also, someone submitted a pull request to make the level select screen remember which levels you've beaten previously, which was exciting! Overall this was a good experience in collaboration.</p>

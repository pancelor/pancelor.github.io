  <p>A recreation (with a twist!) of a boss from Crypt of the NecroDancer. Made for a 1-day long game jam.</p>

  <h3>explanation</h3>
  <p>I just like this boss and wanted to see how hard it would be to recreate. Also, I wanted to see how hard/fun it would be to fight Dead Ringer on a hexagonal grid.</p>
  <p>I'm surprised that this went as smoothly as it did. I scraped together some html game code from another game I'm making, so writing the game engine wasn't much of a hurdle, but I'm surprised the first thing I tried for enemy AI actually worked.</p>
  <p>This was made in a custom javascript engine.</p>

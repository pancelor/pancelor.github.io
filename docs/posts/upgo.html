<p>Made over 2 weeks for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2020">lowrezjam 2020</a>. An exercise in making a platformer with “good game feel” (coyote frames, automatic x-adjustment when hitting the edge of an overhang, queued jump inputs, etc)</p>
<p>Play it online <a href="https://pancelor.itch.io/upgo">here</a>.</p>

<p>This was my first time doing procgen, I think? That was a fun learning experience. I basically re-implemented Spelunky’s level generation by following this excellent <a href="http://tinysubversions.com/spelunkyGen/">explanation</a>. Also, I feel like a switch has flipped in my brain about coordinate systems – there is no “correct” way to do coordinates; you just interpret some numbers however you want.</p>
<p>I wish I had spent more time making this into a “real game” - there’s some good platformer feel and some decent level generation, but the game overall isn’t very gripping. I would have liked to have added some powerups or items or something.</p>

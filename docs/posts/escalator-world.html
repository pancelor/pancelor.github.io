<p>This was an exercise in really really polishing up all of the non-gameplay parts of a game. I think of it as the <a href="https://youtu.be/w20iz92QUco">coinstar monologue</a>, but for videogames :)</p>
<p>Play it online <a href="https://pancelor.itch.io/escalator-world">here</a>! I’m not going to say much about it in this post because that would spoil the entire point of the game :) It’s pretty short. (?)</p>

<h3 id="explanation">explanation</h3>
<p>I made this in a week using the pico-8 engine. It’s based on an old game maker game back in the yoyogames era called “Escalator World” by LeGuy. It’s one of my favorites; one of the few I made sure to download before the yoyogames forums were lost to time…</p>

<p>This was my first time writing game music! I’m happy with how it turned out!</p>
